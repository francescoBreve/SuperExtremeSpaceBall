# SuperExtremeSpaceBall
Super Extreme Space Ball was my frist unity project. It's a small game with 4 levels.
The protagonist of the game is a small ball that has to reach the end of a level by crossing numerous obstacles, facing extreme jumps and collecting coins scattered around the level.
The game is buggy and poorly written but ha some interestings features that can be taken as example, such as:
- Player movements influenced by the camera rotation
- A number of premade prefabas to allow quick level creation
- A save system that saves player's records an times on each level
- A main menu with a level select screen

A pre-builded version of the game can be downloaded here:
